# Healthcare-Project - Usage of T-test and Machine Learning to predict Diabetes Outcome.
Assess the relationship between BMI and Diabetes Outcome to ensure that observed patterns are not due to chance and clear out generalization to larger population using statistical technique such as T-test. Then build ML models to predict the likelihood of having a positive Diabetes outcome based on BMI or other relevant variables.
